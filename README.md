  ## Project Description
  This project aimed to explore mental health (increased stress), focusing on the 16-30 age range and older age groups. The data analyzed included 13 columns describing various aspects such as mood changes, socialization, weight changes, mental health history, and frustration quarantine. Through this analysis, we sought to understand the dynamics of mental health during the quarantine period and discover patterns and factors that influence mental health in this context.

  ## Data Understanding
  - Age: Represents the age of the participants.
  - Gender: Indicates the gender of the participants.
  - Occupation: Represents the participant's occupations.
  - Days_Indoors :Indicates the number of days the participant has not been out of the house
  - Growing_Stress: Indicates the participant's stress is increasing day by day (Yes/Maybe/No).
  - Quarantine_Frustration: Frustrations in the first two weeks of quarantine (Yes/Maybe/No).
  - Changes_Habits: Represents major changes in eating habits and sleeping (Yes/Maybe/No).
  - Mental_Health_History : A precedent of mental disorders in the previous generation (Yes/Maybe/No).
  - Weight_Change :Highlights changes in body weight during quarantine (Yes/Maybe/No)
  - Mood_Swings: Represents extreme mood changes (Low/Medium/High).
  - Coping_Struggles: The inability to cope with daily problems or stress (Yes/No).
  - Work_Interest :Represents whether the participant is losing interest in working (Yes/Maybe/No).
  - Social_Weakness :Conveys feeling mentally weak when interacting with others (Yes/Maybe/No).

  ## Questions
  - What is the age and occupation distribution of the respondents?
  - What is the relationship between stress levels and spending time (days) only inside the house?
  - Does the frustration of quarantine contribute to extreme mood swings?
  - Does someone with a mental health history experience problems in solving problems or stress in daily life?
 
  ## Dashboard

  Through the dashboard visualization presented, it can be seen that the distribution of age and type of employment of respondents tends to be even. The analysis also showed that the most significant increase in stress levels occurred during the first 1-14 days of home quarantine. Interestingly, through this analysis, there was no significant correlation between a person's mental health history and their ability to solve everyday problems.
  
  Thus, it can be concluded that factors such as quarantine duration and environmental conditions may be more instrumental in determining an individual's stress levels during quarantine, while mental health history does not directly affect one's ability to handle daily challenges. This analysis provides valuable insights for further understanding of mental health dynamics in the context of quarantine and may provide a basis for the development of more effective intervention strategies.
